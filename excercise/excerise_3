NOTE: Although you can successfully complete this exercise using any available Linux Academy distribution and version, the solution presented was created on a CentOS 7 Cloud Server. You may have differences in your commands or output depending on the distribution and version you are running.  NOTE: You can use the Linux Academy 'Docker Certification' Cloud Server in lieu of completing a fresh installation and configuration of your environment.

1. Create a container from the base image for the latest version of Ubuntu available (if you do not have an Ubuntu base image installed locally, pull the latest one down for your local repository). The container should be started in interactive mode attached to the current terminal and running the bash shell. Once running, shut the container down by exiting.
	- docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash && exit

2. Run the appropriate Docker command to get the name of the previously run container. Issue the appropriate command to restart the container that you obtained the name of. Do NOT create a new container, restart the one we just used.
	- docker ps -a && docker start <ID> 

3. Stop the container. Remove that container from the system completely using the appropriate command.
	- docker stop <ID> && - docker rm <ID>

4. Create (not run) a container called "my_container", create it with parameters that will allow it to run interactively and attached to the local console running the bash shell. Verify that the container is not running.
	- docker run -it --name my_container ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

5. Start the container and again, verify the container is running. Run the appropriate command to attach your session to the running container so you are logged into the shell.			- docker ps -a && docker start <ID> && docker attach <ID>
