Lecture: State Which Graph Driver Should Be Used on Which OS
------------------------------------------------------------
Storage drivers
	- if you are usng the contianers the way the are intented, you will be storing ;ittle to no data in a contianer writerable layer.
	- Docker volumes are the more appropriate destinations so that the container remains portable.

However, there are some scenarios where writing the container storage layer is a necessity and you will need to choose an appropriate storage driver that is both performant ad supported on your implementation

	- Docker EE offically supported by 
		CentOs - devicemapper
		OEL    - devicemapper
		RHEL   - devicemapper, overlay2
		SUSE   - btrfs
		Ubuntu - aufs3

        - Docker CE offically supported by
                CentOs - devicemapper,vfs
                OEL    - devicemapper,overlay2
                RHEL   - devicemapper, overlay2
                SUSE   - btrfs
                Ubuntu - aufs3,devicemapper,overlay2,overlay,vfs
		Fedora - vfs,devicemapper,overlay2,overlay

Lecture: Summarize How an Image Is Composed of Multiple Layers on the Filesystem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	docker image is builtup  from a series of layers, each representling a sing;e insttruction in the images Dockersfile.Every layer except for the last, is a read only layer.

Lecture: Describe How Storage and Volumes Can Be Used Across Cluster Nodes for Persistent Storage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- The storage can't be used across cluster nodes in general
	-- when you a "docker volume ls", there are 2 different driver
		- local and cloudstorage drivers
		- local is docker native and cloudstorage is meant for the 

	- Lets say, we have create mount with docker volume create command as below
		docker volume create my-mount
  		docker volume inspect my-mount | more
	- Then if you try to deploy a service, with same mount across swarm cluster, with the below command, you notice that the mount is available only on the node it is create but not on all
	   and changes to file inside the mount will not replicated to other nodes
  		 docker service create --name testmount -p 80:80 --mount source=my-mount,target=/internal-mount --replicas 3 httpd

Lecture: Identify the Steps You Would Take to Clean Up Unused Images (and Other Resources) On a File System (CLI)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	docker system prune
	WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
	Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] ?
	
	docker system prune --volumes # prunes all the volumes
	
	docker system prune -a --volumes # prunes all the unwanted and not used docker objects
	
	-- Running docker system prune is not cluster aware command, you will need to run the same command on the nodes in the cluster to make sure everything is cleaned up
