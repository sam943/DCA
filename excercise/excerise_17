NOTE: Although you can complete this exercise using Ubuntu 16.04LTS or CentOS 7 Linux Academy Cloud Servers (which you would then have to have installed Docker CE as detailed in the course already), we have made available a special pre-configured 'Docker Certification' CentOS 7 system for your use with the course and all exercises.
Your company's DNS servers are having issues but you need to launch a web container that can resolve outside named resources. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Using the Docker base image for Ubuntu, create a container with the following characteristics:
  - Interactive
  - Attached to Terminal
  - Using Google Public DNS
  - Named 'mycontainer1'
	-- docker container run -it --dns="8.8.8.8" --dns="8.8.4.4" --name "mycontainer1" /bin/bash

2. Exit the container from Step #1. Using the Docker base image for Ubuntu, create a container with the following characteristics:

  - Interactive
  - Attached to Terminal 
  - Using Google Public DNS
  - Using Domain Search "mydomain.local"
  - Named 'mycontainer2'
	-- docker container run -it --dns-search=mydomain.local" --name "mycontainer1" /bin/bash

3. Exit the container from Step #2. List all the containers. List all characteristics inspected from 'mycontainer2' and then remove and verify removal of all containers.
	docker ps
	docker inspect mycontainer2
	docker rm mycontainer2
