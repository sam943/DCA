  Selecting a Storage Driver
  --------------------------
	- Docker supports several different storage drivers, using a pluggable architecture. The storage driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on your Docker host.
	- try to use the storage driver with the best overall performance and stability in the most usual scenarios.
		- overlay2 is preferred, followed by overlay. Neither of these requires extra configuration. overlay2 is the default choice for Docker CE.
		- devicemapper is next, but requires direct-lvm for production environments, because loopback-lvm, while zero-configuration, has very poor performance
	- devicemapper is officially supported on centos/fedora
	Linux distribution	Recommended storage drivers
	Docker CE on Ubuntu	aufs, devicemapper, overlay2 (Ubuntu 14.04.4 or later, 16.04 or later), overlay, zfs, vfs
	Docker CE on Debian	aufs, devicemapper, overlay2 (Debian Stretch), overlay, vfs
	Docker CE on CentOS	devicemapper, vfs
	Docker CE on Fedora	devicemapper, overlay2 (Fedora 26 or later, experimental), overlay (experimental), vf	

	- If you need to change the storage driver, then you can create daemon.json under /etc/docker and add the storage driver
	- The default storage driver that comes along with docker-ce installation is overlay
	- By the adding below json object into daemon.json and restarting the docker service will change the storage driver
	- JSON object 
		cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
			{
				"storage-driver" : "devicemapper"
			}	
	- restart docker service
		systemctl restart docker.service
	- check the storage driver
		[root@localhost documentation]# docker info | grep Storage
		WARNING: devicemapper: usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use.
		         Use `--storage-opt dm.thinpooldev` to specify a custom block storage device.
		Storage Driver: devicemapper
	- devicemapper is offically supported,recommended storage driver
	- If you are ever changing the storage driver, it is best recommeneded to take the backup/export of the existing images and import after changing the storage drivers
	- Once you change the storage driver to devicemapper, you will notice devicemapper directory under /var/lib/docker/.
	- Any images downloaded will also increase size of this devicemapper
