Exercise: Create a New Bridge Network and Assign a Container To It

1. Display existing Docker networks and names on your host

		-- docker network ls

2. Create a new network as follows:
  * use the 'bridge' driver
  * assigns IP addresses in the '192.168.1.0/24' network range
  * uses a gateway address of 192.168.1.250
  * called 'dev_bridge'

		-- docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.250 dev_bridge

3. Display all Docker networks on the host
		
		-- docker network ls
		
4. Pull the 'httpd' image and install locally
		
		-- docker pull httpd:latest

5. Create a container called 'testweb' based on the image in the previous step as follows:
  * assigned to new 'dev_bridge' network on start
		
		-- docker run -d --name "testweb" --network=dev_bridge httpd

6. Using the appropriately formatted Docker command output, display the container's IP(s) to include the new network
		docker container inspect testweb "{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}"
