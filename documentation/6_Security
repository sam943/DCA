Describe the Process of Signing an Image and Enable Docker Content Trust
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- When you have private registery, and if you have enable entra security to ensure signing happens we can enabled the environment variable DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST

	- If you set DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1, then if there is no validate certificate on client and build machine where you push the images, you will not able to push or pull images from registry

	- To disable set DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0

Lecture: Demonstrate That an Image Passes a Security Scan
---------------------------------------------------------
	- On docker hub image scan can be used only private repositories that are non-free repos
	- Scan will happen to check any vulanerbilities of the image, patches required
	- Once the image is uploaded into docker hub/cloud the regsitry starts scanning the image and reports any issues observed in the component of the image
