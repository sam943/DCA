Describe the Process of Signing an Image and Enable Docker Content Trust
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- When you have private registery, and if you have enable entra security to ensure signing happens we can enabled the environment variable DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST

	- If you set DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1, then if there is no validate certificate on client and build machine where you push the images, you will not able to push or pull images from registry

	- To disable set DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0

Lecture: Demonstrate That an Image Passes a Security Scan
---------------------------------------------------------
	- On docker hub image scan can be used only private repositories that are non-free repos
	- Scan will happen to check any vulanerbilities of the image, patches required
	- Once the image is uploaded into docker hub/cloud the regsitry starts scanning the image and reports any issues observed in the component of the image

Lecture: Identity Roles
-----------------------
	What types are roles are supprted in UCP
		- 2 types of users	
			- Administrators : Admin, and can do anything
			- Regular Users : USers from full control to nothing
		- Only Administrator can make changes to 
			- Swarms
			- User management
			- Organization management
			- team management
			- Roles:
				- NONE : No access to Swarm
				- VIEW ONLY : View services,volumes, networks
				- RESTRICTED CONTROL : Grants the ability to view and edit volumes,networks and images but cannot run servies or container on the running nodes. Restric the ability to mount a node directory or exec into running container
				- SCHEDULER : Allow to view nodes ans schedule workloads. Need additional resources permissions to perform other tasks
				- FULL CONTROL : Allowed to volumes,networks and images as well create containers and services without restrcition : They cannot see other users container or services

Lecture: Configure RBAC and Enable LDAP in UCP
	- Enabling LDAP in UCP
		-From UCP -> Adminstration -> admin settings -> Authentication & Authorization -> LDAP Enabled = "YES | NO"
		- Provide the details and test login

	- Setting RBAC (ROLE BASED AUTH. CONTROL)
		- You can create the roles other than default roles in UCP
		- Create a Role -> Name="Contauiner-testers" -> Operations -> select the required operations -> create
		- Now Create Grant -> Select the role -> Apply to user , team or organization in "Subjects" sections create the grant

Lecture: Demonstrate Creation and Use of UCP Client Bundles and Protect the Docker Daemon With Certificates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-- UCP Client Bundles are used for enabling the CLI between local machine/laptop to manage with UCP on CLI
	-- In the user profile, we need to download client bundles into local machine where you have docker installaed
	-- Unzip the downloaded cient bundle and execute eval $(<env.sh). This will get couple of Docker Environment variable like UCP server, cert path,etc and will give control over UCP based on your access to manage the swarm
	-- If you admin or have full control you can create services on the swarm using UCP CLI from local machine.

Lecture: Describe the Process to Use External Certificates with UCP and DTR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using certificates from a Certificate Authority (like Verisign) is straightforward in your environment. We will show you where your new keys and certificates are installed in UCP.
	- Certificate management is easy in UCP
	- Generate the Certifcate from any CA using UCP hostname or CNAME using openssl
	- Download the cert.pem,intermediate.pem and chain.pem and private.key A
	- From UI, Admin Setting -> Certicates and Update CA Certificate(root cert), Server Certificate, private key -> save

Lecture: Describe Default Docker Swarm and Engine Security
----------------------------------------------------------	
	Docker Engine Security
	- The Host Kernel Support of namespaces and cgroups

		Names provide isolcation to running containers so they cannot see or affect the other processes on the host. Namespaces provide an isloated, process, network and volume stack to enable that isolation		
		Control groups implement resource management(allocating and reporting) to further minimize the effecr of a container on a host. As a result, both play a tole in minimizng various security risks such as denial of service attachs on container, privileage escations exploits etc.
		
	
	- Limited attach surgface of the Docker daemon
		The attach surface is affected by the fact that the daemon requires ROOT account privilegaes, so more care than normal should be applied when changing parameters and known secure default configuration
		Even with trusted users given daemon for control, unknowingly malicious images with "docker load" is a concern

	In addition to docker engine, swarm make heavy use of Overlay network model
	
	This Network model comes prepared with security and support for communication encryption(using the --opt encrypted whne creating network) model
	
	This Network model comes prepared with security and support for communication encryption(using the --opt encrypted whne creating network). But this doesn't support windows

Lecture: Describe MTLS
----------------------
	What is Mutually Authenticated TLS ?
		- learn heart bleed bug	
		- MTLS is method used to communicate within the swarm
		- Mutually Authenticaed TLS is implementeation that was chosed to secure that communication.
		- Any time a swarm is initialized, self-signed certificate authority is generated and issues certificate to every node (manager or worker) to facilitate those secure communications
