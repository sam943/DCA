Exposing Ports to Your Host System
----------------------------------

NOTE: Although you can complete this exercise using Ubuntu 16.04LTS or CentOS 7 Linux Academy Cloud Servers (which you would then have to have installed Docker CE as detailed in the course already), we have made available a special pre-configured 'Docker Certification' CentOS 7 system for your use with the course and all exercises.

You are being asked to run an Nginx container listening on port 80, but that port is not available on the host. Complete the following tasks:

1. Using the appropriate Docker CE commands, download the latest 'nginx' webserver image from Docker Hub.
	
		-- docker pull nginx:latest

2. Instantiate a container based on the 'nginx' image from the previous step. This container should have the following characteristics:
  * when started, the container should run in 'detached' mode
  * name the container 'nginxtest'
  * use the appropriate option to allow Docker to map all container service ports to random host ports over 32768
  * the container is based on the 'nginx' image from step one

		-- docker run -d --name "nginxtest" -P nginx:latest

3. Verify the container is running and find the host port that is mapped to the web server's port 80
		
		-- docker ps && docker inspect nginxtest --format "{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}"

4. Using any tool you wish, verify that the default site page is served (NOTE: use the cloud server's PRIVATE ADDRESS for your testing)
		-- nginxtest --format "{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}" | xargs -I{} elinks http:{}:<port>
