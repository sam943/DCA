Exercise: Pulling a Docker Image from a Repository and Tagging It Locally
NOTE: Although you may use any Linux Academy Cloud Server and distribution that is available to complete these exercises, the course demonstrations, and the provided solutions are all using CentOS 7 executing commands with the 'user' account. NOTE: You can also use the 'Docker Certification' Lab Server and skip the initial installation and setup steps if you feel comfortable with the process.
1. Install Docker and configure it so that it is running and will automatically start on boot.
	- yum update -y && yum install -y docker-ce devicemapper
	- systemctl enable docker and systemctl start docker
2. Using the appropriate Docker commands pull the latest 'Ubuntu' image from the repository so that it is available for container instantiation on your local system.
	- docker pull Ubuntu:latest
3. Display the images currently installed on the local system to confirm that the 'Ubuntu' image is available from the prior step.
	- docker images
4. Tag the 'ubuntu:latest' image that you have downloaded so that you can refer to it with a shorter name. Choose to tag the image with the name and tag 'my:ubuntu'
	- docker image tag ubuntu:latest my:ubuntu
5. Display the resulting image list on your system to confirm the previous comman
	- docker images
